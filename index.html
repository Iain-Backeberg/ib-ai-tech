IBAI’s mission was to help you work smarter, serve clients better, and bridge the gap between people, processes, technology, and AI.

However, with the rapid development and release of so many free tools that offer similar capabilities, I simply can’t keep up with the pace of change as a solopreneur. It’s no longer viable to compete in this ever-evolving space.

Thank you for your support and interest in IBAI.
