<h3>IBAI ‚Äì Terms & Conditions</h3>
<b>Effective Date: </b>15 August 2025
<br>
<p style='font-size: 15px;'>
<b>1. Introduction</b><br>
Welcome to IBAI (ib-ai.tech), operated by Iain Backeberg. By accessing this website or using my services, you agree to these Terms & Conditions.<br>
Your use of my Services is also subject to my Cookie Policy and Privacy Policy, which covers how I collect, use, share, and store your personal information.<br><br>

<b>2. Services</b><br>
I provide bespoke AI frameworks and solutions, including but not limited to: chatbots, automation tools, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and custom AI systems.<br>
All production-ready frameworks are deployed on client-controlled platforms or sites.<br>
Pricing is bespoke per project and is not listed on the website.<br><br>

<b>3. Payment Terms</b><br>
Payment for all services and frameworks is 50% upfront and 50% upon delivery or as otherwise agreed in a written quotation.<br>
Clients shall pay Iain Backeberg directly via a payment method of his choosing.<br>
Any potential third-party costs incurred for the solution provided (e.g., software licenses, hosting fees, APIs) are the sole responsibility of the client.<br>
I am not responsible for managing or paying third-party costs, nor am I liable for any third-party terms and conditions.<br><br>

<b>4. Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)</b><br>
I will not sign any Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), prohibitive or otherwise.<br>
All engagements, licensing, and service provisions are governed solely by these Terms & Conditions and any project-specific agreements I issue.<br><br>

<b>5. Intellectual Property & Licensing</b><br>
I retain full ownership of the frameworks, code, and templates I provide.<br>
Clients are granted a license, upon receipt of full payment and development completion, to deploy the final-approved AI solution, as provisioned in the accepted written agreement and quotation, as-is on their own platforms.<br>
No intellectual property, frameworks, code, or templates will be shared under any circumstances unless a written agreement or accepted quotation has been issued and payment has been received, in terms of the Payment Terms (Clause 3) in these Terms and Conditions.<br>
Clients may not modify, copy, redistribute, sublicense, reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code from the frameworks. Failing this, legal action will be instituted against the offending party, in accordance with the laws of South Africa (Clause 15 ‚Äì Governing Law).<br>
All AI-generated outputs produced through client deployment belong solely to the client.<br>
The license is strictly limited to deployment on the client‚Äôs platforms only. Any breach may result in termination of access. Failing this, legal action will be instituted against the offending party, in accordance with the laws of South Africa (Clause 15 ‚Äì Governing Law).<br>
Updates or patches I provide remain my IP and are subject to the same licensing rules.<br><br>

<b>6. Confidentiality / Non-Disclosure</b><br>
All frameworks, code, templates, documentation, and related materials are confidential.<br>
Clients must not share or disclose any of these materials outside their organisation.<br> 
Failing this, legal action will be instituted against the offending party, in accordance with the laws of South Africa (Clause 15 ‚Äì Governing Law).<br><br>

<b>7. Demos & Evaluation</b><br>
Demos on this website or via linked platforms are for evaluation purposes only.<br>
In compliance with your applicable local regulations and privacy laws, no personal or private information is stored on any servers. All files are stored in temporary memory, which is cleared when you close or reload the page.<br>
Demo outputs remain part of the frameworks I provide and are not the client‚Äôs intellectual property. They are provided solely for demonstration and evaluation purposes and do not confer any ownership or licensing rights to the client.<br><br>

<b>8. Client Responsibilities</b><br>
Provide accurate information and timely access to any necessary data for project completion.<br>
Ensure compliance with all applicable laws regarding AI use.<br><br>

<b>9. Indemnity</b><br>
Clients agree to indemnify and hold me harmless from any claims, losses, or damages arising from misuse of the frameworks, violation of IP rights, or breach of these Terms.<br><br>

<b>10. Privacy & Data</b><br>
Personal data collected through the website or demos is used only for service delivery, communication, or evaluation purposes.<br>
I will not sell or share personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.<br>
I am not liable for any breach of privacy caused by clients or third-party services.<br>
See my Privacy Policy for full details.<br><br>

<b>11. Limitation of Liability</b><br>
Frameworks and AI outputs are provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù for client deployment.<br>
I am not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential losses arising from the use or deployment of AI frameworks by clients.<br><br>

<b>12. Third-Party Services Disclaimer</b><br>
AI solutions developed and provided may include third-party services, integrations, or embedded content (e.g., demos, APIs, hosting platforms).<br>
I am not responsible or liable for any collection, storage, or processing of personal information by these third parties. Users should review third-party privacy and cookie policies.<br><br>

<b>13. Integration & Client-Managed Systems</b><br>
All AI solutions provided by IBAI are integrated into client-managed systems or servers. IBAI requires appropriate access, credentials, and permissions to perform these integrations.<br> 
IBAI shall not be liable for any data loss, system downtime, security breaches, or other issues arising from the client‚Äôs infrastructure or third-party services.<br> 
Clients are solely responsible for ensuring their systems function correctly and for the management, security, and privacy of any data processed within them.<br><br>

<b>14. Termination & Legal Action</b><br>
I reserve the right to terminate access to frameworks or demos and pursue legal action if these Terms and Conditions are breached.<br><br>

<b>15. Governing Law</b><br>
These Terms are governed by the laws of South Africa.<br><br>

<b>16. Changes</b><br>
I may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the website or frameworks constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.<br><br>

Copyright ¬© 2025 Iain Backeberg (IBAI). All rights reserved. The frameworks, code, templates, and any associated materials are the intellectual property of Iain Backeberg. Unauthorized copying, redistribution, modification, or use outside the licensed deployment is strictly prohibited.<br><br>

<b>18. Force Majeure</b><br>
I am not liable for any failure or delay in providing services, frameworks, or demos if such failure is due to events beyond my reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, internet outages, third-party service failures, strikes, or governmental actions.<br>
Clients acknowledge that temporary unavailability of demos, frameworks, or APIs does not constitute a breach of these Terms.<br><br>

<b>19. Dispute Resolution</b><br>
Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms shall first be attempted to be resolved amicably through good-faith negotiation between the parties.<br>
If resolution cannot be reached within 30 days, the dispute may be escalated to mediation or arbitration in accordance with South African law.<br>
Litigation may only be pursued in South African courts after attempting negotiation and/or mediation.<br><br>
